    Fix a Haar measure $\mu$ on $R$ and a continuous real-valued function
  on $R$ with compact support and such that $\int f(x) d\mu(x)\not=0$.
  Then $u \mapsto \int f(ux) d\mu(x)$ is a continuous function
  of $R\to\R$ (because a continuous function with compact support is uniformly
   continuous) and thus gives a continuous function $R^\times\to\R$.
   Thus the function $u\mapsto (\int f(ux) d\mu(x))/(\int f(x)d\mu(x))$ is
   a continuous function from $R^\times$ to $\R$ taking values in $\R_{>0}$.
   Hence $\delta_R$ is continuous, from `mulEquivHaarChar_mul_integral`
   in the AddEquiv file
