# Flat characters of local Galois groups

Fix a prime `ℓ`, and let `ℚ_ℓ` denote the `ℓ`-adic completion of `ℚ` (implemented, as
everywhere in this repository, as the `v`-adic completion at the finite place `v` of `ℚ`
corresponding to `ℓ`).  For a finite extension `K/ℚ_ℓ` inside a fixed algebraic closure
`ℚ̄_ℓ`, with ring of integers `𝒪_K` (the integral closure of `𝒪_{ℚ_ℓ}` in `K`), and an
algebraically closed field `𝕂` of characteristic `ℓ`, we define what it means for a character

  `ψ : Gal(ℚ̄_ℓ/K) →* 𝕂ˣ`

to be **flat** (`IsFlatCharacter`): `ψ` is continuous for the discrete topology on `𝕂ˣ`
(i.e. has open kernel), and the one-dimensional `𝕂`-representation `𝕂(ψ)` of
`Gal(ℚ̄_ℓ/K)` is a subquotient of `A(ℚ̄_ℓ) ⊗ 𝕂` for some finite flat commutative group
scheme `A` over `𝒪_K` killed by `ℓ`.

Following the conventions of `GaloisRep.HasFlatProlongationAt`
(`FLT.Deformations.RepresentationTheory.GaloisRep`), the group scheme is encoded as a finite
flat Hopf algebra `A` over `𝒪_K`, and its `ℚ̄_ℓ`-points as the group
`Additive (K ⊗[𝒪_K] A →ₐ[K] ℚ̄_ℓ)` of `K`-algebra homomorphisms from the generic fibre,
with `Gal(ℚ̄_ℓ/K)` acting by postcomposition.  Two further encoding choices:

* Rather than putting hypotheses on the abstract points monoid, we ask (as in
  `HasFlatProlongationAt`) for an equivariant additive isomorphism `f` from the points to an
  auxiliary abelian group `P` equipped with an action `act` of `Gal(ℚ̄_ℓ/K)`.  The condition
  "`A` is killed by `ℓ`" is encoded as `∀ x : P, ℓ • x = 0`: for a *flat* group scheme over
  `𝒪_K`, being killed by `ℓ` is equivalent to its generic fibre being killed by `ℓ`
  (the coordinate ring injects into that of the generic fibre), which — the generic fibre
  being étale, since `K` has characteristic zero — is in turn equivalent to the group of
  `ℚ̄_ℓ`-points being killed by `ℓ`.  Note that commutativity of the group scheme is also
  subsumed: the points biject with the abelian group `P`, and a finite flat group scheme in
  characteristic zero fibre... more precisely the flat group scheme is commutative iff its
  (dense, by flatness) generic fibre is, iff its `ℚ̄_ℓ`-points are.
* "`𝕂(ψ)` is a subquotient of `A(ℚ̄_ℓ) ⊗_{𝔽_ℓ} 𝕂`" is encoded as: there are submodules
  `W₁ ≤ W₂` of `𝕂 ⊗[ℤ] P` with `W₁ ≠ W₂` such that every `σ` moves every `w ∈ W₂` to
  `ψ(σ) • w` modulo `W₁`.  (This forces `W₁` and `W₂` to be stable, and says exactly that the
  nonzero quotient `W₂/W₁` is `ψ`-isotypic, i.e. that `𝕂(ψ)` is a Jordan–Hölder constituent
  of `𝕂 ⊗ P`.  Since `P` is killed by `ℓ` and `𝕂` has characteristic `ℓ`, the tensor
  product over `ℤ` agrees with the tensor product over `𝔽_ℓ`.)

This definition is the interface between the two *assumed* statements S1 (the local theorem,
`FLT.Slop.CyclotomicAbsIrred.Assumed.flat_character_tame_bound`) and S2 (flatness of
stable-line characters, `FLT.Slop.CyclotomicAbsIrred.Assumed.isFlatCharacter_of_stable_line`);
see `abs_irred_v2.tex` §2 for the mathematical content and literature references.
