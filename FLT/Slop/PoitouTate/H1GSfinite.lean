# `p`-finiteness from Mazur's condition `Φ_p`

This file completes the proof, for a **compact** (e.g. profinite) group `G` satisfying Mazur's
finiteness condition `Φ_p` (`MazurFinite`), that `Z¹_cont(G, S)` is **finite** for every finite
discrete `𝔽_p`-vector space `S` with a continuous `G`-action
(`finite_oneCocycles_of_mazurFinite`).

Two ingredients:
* **Layer 3** (`finite_oneCocycles_of_trivial_action`): for an *open* subgroup `N` acting
  *trivially* on `S`, the cocycles `Z¹(N, S) = Hom_cont(N, S)` are finite. Picking an
  `𝔽_p`-basis
  `S ≅ 𝔽_p^d`, a cocycle's `i`-th coordinate is a continuous homomorphism `N → ℤ/p`, and
  these
  jointly determine it; finiteness of each coordinate space is exactly `Φ_p`.
* **Layer 2** (`finite_oneCocycles_of_finite_quotient`, from `InfRes`): the inflation–restriction
  squeeze. Taking `N₀` to be the (open, normal) pointwise stabilizer of `S`, which acts trivially
  on
  *all* of `S`, the squeeze reduces `Z¹(G, S)` to `Z¹(G/N₀, S)` (finite: `G/N₀` and `S`
  finite) and
  `Z¹(N₀, S)` (Layer 3).

Notably this needs **no composition-series dévissage**: the `𝔽_p`-basis decomposition in Layer 3
already performs the reduction to `ℤ/p` coefficients.

Current state: this file defines `MazurFinite` (the condition `Φ_p`) and states the
`p`-finiteness proposition with `sorry`; the two ingredient lemmas described above are TODO.

/-- **Mazur's finiteness condition `Φ_p`** (Mazur, *Deforming Galois representations*, §1.1):
every open subgroup `N ≤ G` admits only finitely many continuous homomorphisms to `ℤ/p`.
The full absolute Galois group of a number field fails this (infinitely many `ℤ/p`-extensions
as the ramification set varies), but `G_{F,S}` satisfies it by Hermite–Minkowski — cf. the
`Φ_p` discussion in `GKSDefn.lean`. -/
