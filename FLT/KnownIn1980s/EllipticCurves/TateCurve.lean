# The Tate curve

Let `k` be a nonarchimedean local field and let `E/k` be an elliptic curve, given by a
minimal Weierstrass equation, with split multiplicative reduction. Tate's theory attaches
to `E` a canonical *Tate parameter*, an element `q = q(E)` of `k` with `0 < |q| < 1`, and
an isomorphism of groups `E(k) ≅ kˣ/qᶻ` (Tate's uniformisation). The construction is
functorial: if `k → l` is a valuation-compatible morphism of nonarchimedean local fields
then the base change of `E` to `l` again has split multiplicative reduction, the Tate
parameter of the base change is the image of `q`, and the uniformisations over `k` and `l`
fit into a commutative diagram — in general only up to an unremovable sign, but on the nose
when the morphism is `k`-linear (see `tateEquiv_baseChange` and `tateEquiv_galois`). The
`k`-linear case gives the Galois-equivariance needed to compute the Galois representations
attached to `E`.

These results are due to Tate, in a manuscript which
circulated from the early 1960s and was eventually published in 1995 as *A review of
non-Archimedean elliptic curves*. See also Roquette, *Analytic theory of elliptic
functions over local fields* (1970), and Silverman, *Advanced topics in the arithmetic
of elliptic curves*, V.3 and V.5, for textbook accounts.

## TODO

* **Rank 1 generality.** Tate's theory works over any field complete with respect to a
  nontrivial rank 1 (i.e. real-valued) nonarchimedean valuation, for example `ℂ_p` or the
  completion of the maximal unramified extension of `ℚ_p`: completeness and `|q| < 1` are
  all that is needed for the relevant power series to converge. But right now we can't
  talk about an elliptic curve over `ℂ_p` having split multiplicative reduction, so we
  stick to nonarchimedean local fields: mathlib's
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` is defined via minimal Weierstrass
  equations, and mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.IsMinimal` requires
  `IsDiscreteValuationRing` (its existence theorem `exists_isMinimal` is proved by
  well-foundedness of the value group, which fails for dense value groups).

  Mathematics question: is there a theory of minimal models for elliptic curves
  with multiplicative reduction over fields complete wrt an arbitrary rank 1 valuation?
  For additive reduction you have no chance (consider `y² = x³ + p` over `ℂₚ`).

* **Topology.** `tateEquiv` below should be an isomorphism of *topological* groups, where
  `kˣ/qᶻ` carries the quotient topology and `E(k)` the topology coming from `k`. This
  cannot currently be stated: mathlib has no topology on `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`
  (nor on `Projectivization`, from which it could be induced).

* **Signs.** There is a choice of sign for the Tate uniformisation. I propose that we
  simply use the definition in e.g. Silverman. One could say explicitly what the sign
  is by asking what the pullback of the invariant differential `dx/(2y + a₁x + a₃)` to
  `kˣ` is; it will be some constant times `du/u` (for the Tate curve `E_q` itself, with
  Silverman's series, it is exactly `du/u`).

/-! ### The Tate curve `E_q`

For `q` with `0 < |q| < 1` there is an explicit Weierstrass curve `E_q`, whose coefficients
are power series in `q` with integer coefficients, together with a uniformisation
`kˣ/qᶻ ≅ E_q(k)` given by explicit power series `X(u, q)`, `Y(u, q)` — all of it involving
no choices whatsoever, and commuting on the nose with every valuative morphism of fields.
The uniformisation of a general `E` with split multiplicative reduction is obtained by
transporting this one along an isomorphism `E_{q(E)} ≅ E` of Weierstrass curves
(`exists_variableChange_tateCurve` below), and *that* is the only choice in the theory:
there are exactly two such isomorphisms, differing by negation.

commute with the power series defining Tate's theory; it is automatic for `k`-embeddings

complete field `k`), but not for arbitrary abstract field morphisms.

/-! ### Torsion and the Weil pairing

Passing to the limit over the finite subextensions of a separable closure `Ω` of `k`, the
uniformisations above glue to a Galois-equivariant uniformisation `E(Ω) ≅ Ωˣ/qᶻ`. The
`N`-torsion of `Ωˣ/qᶻ` is generated by the `N`-th roots of unity and (the classes of) the
`N`-th roots of `q`, so the uniformisation identifies the `N`-torsion of `E` explicitly:
this is how one computes the Galois representations attached to `E`.

The identification is compatible with the Weil pairing: with a suitable sign convention in
the definition of the Weil pairing `e_N`, we have `e_N(ζ, q^{1/N}) = ζ` for every `N`-th
root of unity `ζ` and every `N`-th root `q^{1/N}` of `q`, where on the left-hand side units
are identified with points of `E` via the uniformisation. This is the content of
`weilPairing_tatePoint` below; see the comment there for exactly what this does and
does not pin down.
