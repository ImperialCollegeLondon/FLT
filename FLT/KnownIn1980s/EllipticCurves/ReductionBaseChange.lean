# Reduction theory under base change

Let `k → l` be a valuative extension of nonarchimedean local fields and let `E/k` be an
elliptic curve with split multiplicative reduction. This file proves that the two reduction
instances currently sorried in `FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.TateCurve` transfer to the
base change (stated for an arbitrary such `E`, not just Tate curves):

* `(E.baseChange l).IsMinimal 𝒪[l]` (`isMinimal_baseChange`, and the
  `HasMultiplicativeReduction` instance which yields it by parent projection)
* `(E.baseChange l).HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction 𝒪[l]`

Neither is provable by assembling existing declarations: mathlib's reduction API
(`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction`) has no minimality criterion and no
base-change results at all, and mathlib's `ValuativeExtension` provides only the map of
value groups `mapValueGroupWithZero`, not the induced ring map `𝒪[k] →+* 𝒪[l]` of rings
of integers. FLT PR #1081 (branch `logos2`) also leaves both instances sorried.

## Mathematical route

The whole point is that minimality by itself is *not* preserved by base change —
`y² = x³ + p` is minimal over `ℚ_p` but not over `ℚ_p(p^{1/6})` — so one cannot argue
about minimality abstractly. The multiplicative reduction hypothesis rescues everything
through a single mechanism: it forces `|c₄| = 1`, and "integral with `|c₄| = 1`" is a
property that (i) forces minimality and (ii) is visibly preserved by any valuative
extension.

Mathlib phrases `HasMultiplicativeReduction` at the *field level* — its two non-parent
fields are statements about the adic valuation of `W.Δ` and `W.c₄` as elements of the
field — and this branch already has both halves of the translation apparatus:

* the bridges `ValuativeRel.adicValuation_lt_one_iff` and `adicValuation_eq_one_iff`
  (`FLT.Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.ValuativeRel.Basic`) convert between the adic
  valuation of the DVR `𝒪[k]`, in which mathlib's reduction theory is phrased, and the
  canonical valuation of `k`, on the two distinctions that matter (`< 1` and `= 1`);
* strict monotonicity of `ValuativeExtension.mapValueGroupWithZero` transfers the
  canonical valuation along `k → l`.

So everything except the minimality criterion and the splitness clause is a field-level
valuation chase along the chain *adic over `k` → canonical over `k` → canonical over `l`
→ adic over `l`*. In detail:

0. **Transfer of the canonical valuation**
   (`ValuativeExtension.valuation_algebraMap_le_one`, `_lt_one`, `_eq_one` — proved
   below, not sorried). A valuative extension preserves `|x| ≤ 1`, `|x| < 1` and
   `|x| = 1`, because `mapValueGroupWithZero` is a strictly monotone monoid-with-zero
   homomorphism sending `valuation k x` to `valuation l (algebraMap k l x)`. (The `< 1`
   case duplicates `TateCurve.valuation_algebraMap_lt_one` from `TateCurveBaseChange`;
   when de-blueprinting, consolidate all three next to the bridges in
   `FLT.Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.ValuativeRel.Basic`.)

1. **Functoriality of the integers** (`ValuativeExtension.integerMap`), needed *only*
   for the splitness clause (step 5). By `valuation_algebraMap_le_one`, `algebraMap k l`
   restricts to a map `𝒪[k] →+* 𝒪[l]`; it is a local homomorphism (by
   `valuation_algebraMap_lt_one`) and hence induces a map of residue fields
   (`residueMap`). The `IsMinimal` and `HasMultiplicativeReduction` transfers below do
   not use any of this.

2. **The minimality criterion** (`WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_c₄_eq_one`).
   An integral Weierstrass equation whose `c₄` has adic valuation `1` is minimal — the
   unit-`c₄` case of the Kraus–Laska criterion "`v(c₄) < 4` or `v(Δ) < 12` implies
   minimal" (Silverman AEC, Remark VII.1.1). This is the one genuinely new piece of
   mathematics, and it is mathlib-worthy. It is stated at the field level to match
   mathlib's `HasMultiplicativeReduction.multiplicativeReduction`, which is exactly the
   fact consumers hold.

3. **Base change of the integral model.** Integrality transfers coefficientwise: each
   coefficient of `E.baseChange l` is `algebraMap k l` of the corresponding coefficient
   of `E`, and `valuation_algebraMap_le_one` keeps it integral
   (`isIntegral_of_exists_lift`). For the splitness clause we also record
   `integralModel_baseChange_map`: the integral model of the base change is the
   `integerMap`-image of the integral model, by uniqueness of lifts along the injective
   map `𝒪[l] → l`.

4. **Multiplicative reduction.** `badReduction` and `multiplicativeReduction` transfer
   along the chain above: adic `|Δ| < 1` over `k` converts to the canonical valuation
   (`adicValuation_lt_one_iff` + `integralModel_Δ_eq`), moves along the extension
   (`valuation_algebraMap_lt_one` + `map_Δ`), and converts back over `l`
   (`adicValuation_lt_one_iff` again); same for `|c₄| = 1` with the `eq_one` lemmas.
   Minimality is step 2 applied to the transferred `|c₄| = 1`. No `integerMap`, no
   `IsLocalHom`. Note multiplicative reduction is preserved by *arbitrary* extensions of
   local fields (Silverman AEC, VII.5.4(b)) — no unramifiedness is needed, in contrast
   to good reduction.

5. **Splitness.** Mathlib's `HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` demands that the explicit
   quadratic `c₄T² + a₁c₄T - (54b₆ - 3b₂b₄ + a₂c₄)` (tangent directions at the node)
   split over the residue field. By 3 the quadratic of the `l`-model is the image of
   the quadratic of the `k`-model under the induced map of residue fields
   (`IsLocalRing.ResidueField.map (integerMap k l)`), and a split polynomial stays split
   under any ring map (`Polynomial.Splits.map`). Splitness can only be gained, never
   lost, when the residue field grows. This is the only step that uses `integerMap`,
   `residueMap` and `integralModel_baseChange_map`.

The base-change transfer is packaged as `theorem`s here rather than `instance`s, so that
the consuming instances live in `FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.TateCurve`, where this file
is imported: the two sorried instances there are filled by `isMinimal_baseChange` and
`hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange` (which also yields `IsMinimal` and
`HasMultiplicativeReduction` by class-parent projection).

The `k`-side adic → canonical conversions of `valuation_c₄_baseChange_eq_one` and
`valuation_Δ_baseChange_lt_one` duplicate the downstream `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_c₄_eq_one`
and `valuation_Δ_lt_one` of `TateCurve`; they are reduction-theoretic rather than
Tate-theoretic, so consider extracting the `k`-side halves as shared lemmas (or moving those
`TateCurve` lemmas here) when de-blueprinting.

/-! ### Step 0: transfer of the canonical valuation

A valuative extension preserves `≤ 1`, `< 1` and `= 1` of the canonical valuation:
`mapValueGroupWithZero` is a strictly monotone monoid-with-zero homomorphism matching
the two valuations. These are proved (for arbitrary valuative extensions of rings) in
`FLT.Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.ValuativeRel.Basic` as
`ValuativeExtension.valuation_algebraMap_le_one`, `_lt_one` and `_eq_one`; they are used
just below to build `integerMap`. (The `< 1` case supersedes
`TateCurve.valuation_algebraMap_lt_one` in `TateCurveBaseChange`.)
-/

/-! ### Step 1: functoriality of the ring of integers

A valuative extension `k → l` restricts to a local homomorphism `𝒪[k] →+* 𝒪[l]` and
hence induces a map of residue fields. Only the valuative structure is needed — no
topology, no local-field hypothesis — so this subsection is stated for arbitrary
valuative fields; it is all mathlib-ready material. In this file it is needed *only* for
the splitness clause of `HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`: the `IsMinimal` and
`HasMultiplicativeReduction` transfers stay at the field level throughout.

The unit-`c₄` case of the Kraus–Laska criterion (Silverman AEC, Remark VII.1.1) — an
integral Weierstrass equation whose `c₄` has adic valuation `1` is minimal — is proved
(over an arbitrary discrete valuation ring with fraction field, as in mathlib's
`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction`) in
`FLT.Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction` as
`WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_c₄_eq_one`. Its hypothesis is at the field
level, matching mathlib's phrasing of `HasMultiplicativeReduction.multiplicativeReduction`
— exactly the fact `isMinimal_baseChange` below holds after transferring `c₄`.

`𝒪[k]`, so the node polynomial transfers as `map_nodePoly`. The residue square
