-- A linter complains that the below theorem (which at the time of writing is not sorry-free)
-- does not ever assume `[IsTotallyReal F]` or `IsTotallyDefinite F D`.
-- I've dropped the assumptions for now, but it might need
-- to be reinstated later. The crucial fact is apparently that D is a division ring.
-- Perhaps what's going on is that if D is something like the discriminant 6 quat alg
-- over ℚ (so unramified at infinity) then maybe the space is trivially only the constant

Let `D/F` be a totally definite quaterion algebra over a totally real
field. Then the space of `K`-valued weight 2 level `U` quaternionic automorphic forms
for `Dˣ` is finite-dimensional over `K`.
