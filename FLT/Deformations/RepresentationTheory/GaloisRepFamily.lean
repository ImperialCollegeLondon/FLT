/-- A family `ρ_λ` of `E_λ`-adic Galois representations `GaloisRepFamily K E d` of the
absolute Galois group of a number field `K` is *compatible* if there is a finite set `S` of
finite places of `K` and, for each finite place `v` of `K` not in `S`, a monic
degree `d` polynomial `P_v` with coefficients in `E`, such that if
`v` and `λ` do not lie above the same rational prime then `ρ_λ` is unramified at `v`
and `P_v` is the characteristic polynomial of `ρ_λ(Frob_v)`, where `Frob_v` denotes
an arithmetic Frobenius element.

This is the weakest possible concept of a compatible family but it will
suffice for our needs.
