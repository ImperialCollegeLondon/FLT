  `IsIrreducible ρ` is the statement that a given Representation ρ is irreducible
  (also known as simple),
  meaning that any subrepresentation must be either the full one (⊤) or zero (⊥)

  This notion is only well behaved when the representation is over a field k. If it were defined
  over a ring A with a nontrivial ideal J, the subrepresentation JW would often be a non trivial
  subrepresentation, so ρ would rarely be irreducible.

  `IsAbsolutelyIrreducible ρ` states that a given Representation ρ over a field k
  is absolutely irreducible, meaning that all the possible base change extensions are irreducible.
