# Fixed points of actions

We define types representing fixed points of actions on types, and
define inherited typeclasses on these fixed point types. For example
the fixed points of an action on an additive group is an additive group.

## Main definitions

Given types `M` and `A`, with `[SMul M A]`,
* `MulAction.FixedPoints M A` is the subtype of `A` consisting of the `a`
  such that `∀ m, m • a = a`.

Similarly, with `[VAdd M A]`,
* `AddAction.FixedPoints M A` is the subtype of `A` consisting of the `a`
  satisfying the unlikely-looking equation `∀ m, m +ᵥ a = a`.

## Notes

Note that the type `MulAction.FixedPoints` is the coercion to a type
of the term `MulAction.fixedPoints` (which, presumably for historical
reasons, is defined under a spurious extra hypothesis that `M` is a monoid).
The motivation for this file is that using `↥fixedPoints` can lead
typeclass inference on a wild goose chase.
