Proof: First, it suffices to show that if M has the R-module topology
τRM then it's a topological S-module, and that if M has the S-module
topology τSM then it's a topological R-module. This is because the former
claim shows τSM ≤ τRM and the latter shows τRM ≤ τSM.

If M has the S-module topology then it's clearly a topological R-module,
because it's a topological S-module so (+ : M × M → M) is continuous
and (• : S × M → M) are continuous, and the map R → S is continuous
because it's R-linear and S has the R-module topology, so
R × M → S × M is continuous and thus (• : R × M → M) is continuous.

The converse is more subtle and it's here where we need some finiteness
assumptions. If M has the R-module topology then certainly (+ : M × M → M)
is continuous, so it all rests on showing that (• : S × M → M) is
continuous. But everything here is an R-module and • is R-bilinear,
and thus if either S or M are module-finite over R the result is
automatic.

Proof.

First note that `S` is a topological ring so addition and multiplication
on `S` are continuous. Futhermore the hypothesis `Contiuous (algebraMap R S)`
shows that • : R × S → S is continuous, so S is a topological R-module.
In particular the identity map (S,R-module top) -> (S, given top) is continuous.

The algebra map from R to (S,R-module top) is R-linear
and hence also continuous. Furthermore, the composite is open
and I claim that the two topologies on S thus "look the same near 0".
More precisely, the image of R is open in S with the given topology
and hence also with the module topology (by continuity of the identity map above),
and if U ⊆ S is a subset of the image of R then we claim that it's open for
the given topology iff it's open for the module topology. Firstly,
continuity of the identity
map shows that if U is open for the given topology it's open for the module
topology. Secondly, if U is open for the module topology then its preimage
in R is open for R's topology, and then the image of this in S is open for
the given topology, and this is U again as U is a subset of the image of R.

Consequence: if one defines the finite adeles of a number field K
as K ⊗[ℤ] ℤ-hat and gives it the ℤ-hat-module topology,
this gives the right answer. Proof: algebraically we have 𝔸_K^f=𝔸_ℚ^f ⊗[ℚ] K
and 𝔸_ℚ^f=ℤhat ⊗[ℤ] ℚ, so certainly 𝔸_K^f=K ⊗[ℤ] ℤhat algebraically.
It thus suffices to show that the topologies agree. Writing R for the integers
of K we have K = K ⊗[R] R so 𝔸_K^f = ℤhat ⊗[ℤ] R ⊗[R] K = Rhat ⊗[R] K
and because Rhat is open in K with its usual topology this shows that 𝔸_K^f
has the Rhat-module topology by one of the above results. And Rhat=Zhat ⊗[ℤ] R
is finite over ℤhat so we're done if we can check that Rhat with its usual
topology is the ℤhat topology and this should be fine, it's finite and free
over a complete thing so I don't think there can be any other possibility
(the argument is weak here)

are equivalent as `S₂`-algebras, then they are topologically equivalent as `S₂`-algebras as well
(even though they do not necessarily have the `S₂`-module topologies).

In application this is used for a situation where we have
```
