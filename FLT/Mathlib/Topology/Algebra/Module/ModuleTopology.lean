Proof: First, it suffices to show that if M has the R-module topology
œÑRM then it's a topological S-module, and that if M has the S-module
topology œÑSM then it's a topological R-module. This is because the former
claim shows œÑSM ‚â§ œÑRM and the latter shows œÑRM ‚â§ œÑSM.

If M has the S-module topology then it's clearly a topological R-module,
because it's a topological S-module so (+ : M √ó M ‚Üí M) is continuous
and (‚Ä¢ : S √ó M ‚Üí M) are continuous, and the map R ‚Üí S is continuous
because it's R-linear and S has the R-module topology, so
R √ó M ‚Üí S √ó M is continuous and thus (‚Ä¢ : R √ó M ‚Üí M) is continuous.

The converse is more subtle and it's here where we need some finiteness
assumptions. If M has the R-module topology then certainly (+ : M √ó M ‚Üí M)
is continuous, so it all rests on showing that (‚Ä¢ : S √ó M ‚Üí M) is
continuous. But everything here is an R-module and ‚Ä¢ is R-bilinear,
and thus if either S or M are module-finite over R the result is
automatic.

    (hopen : IsOpenMap (algebraMap R S)) : IsModuleTopology R S := by

Proof.

First note that `S` is a topological ring so addition and multiplication
on `S` are continuous. Futhermore the hypothesis `Contiuous (algebraMap R S)`
shows that ‚Ä¢ : R √ó S ‚Üí S is continuous, so S is a topological R-module.
In particular the identity map (S,R-module top) -> (S, given top) is continuous.

The algebra map from R to (S,R-module top) is R-linear
and hence also continuous. Furthermore, the composite is open
and I claim that the two topologies on S thus "look the same near 0".
More precisely, the image of R is open in S with the given topology
and hence also with the module topology (by continuity of the identity map above),
and if U ‚äÜ S is a subset of the image of R then we claim that it's open for
the given topology iff it's open for the module topology. Firstly,
continuity of the identity
map shows that if U is open for the given topology it's open for the module
topology. Secondly, if U is open for the module topology then its preimage
in R is open for R's topology, and then the image of this in S is open for
the given topology, and this is U again as U is a subset of the image of R.

Consequence: if one defines the finite adeles of a number field K
as K ‚äó[‚Ñ§] ‚Ñ§-hat and gives it the ‚Ñ§-hat-module topology,
this gives the right answer. Proof: algebraically we have ùî∏_K^f=ùî∏_‚Ñö^f ‚äó[‚Ñö] K
and ùî∏_‚Ñö^f=‚Ñ§hat ‚äó[‚Ñ§] ‚Ñö, so certainly ùî∏_K^f=K ‚äó[‚Ñ§] ‚Ñ§hat algebraically.
It thus suffices to show that the topologies agree. Writing R for the integers
of K we have K = K ‚äó[R] R so ùî∏_K^f = ‚Ñ§hat ‚äó[‚Ñ§] R ‚äó[R] K = Rhat ‚äó[R] K
and because Rhat is open in K with its usual topology this shows that ùî∏_K^f
has the Rhat-module topology by one of the above results. And Rhat=Zhat ‚äó[‚Ñ§] R
is finite over ‚Ñ§hat so we're done if we can check that Rhat with its usual
topology is the ‚Ñ§hat topology and this should be fine, it's finite and free
over a complete thing so I don't think there can be any other possibility
(the argument is weak here)

Given the following
```
e : A <‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> B
     \     /\    /
      \   /  \  /

           R
```
where `A` and `B` are both `S‚ÇÅ` and `S‚ÇÇ`-algebras, `S‚ÇÅ` and `S‚ÇÇ` are algebras
over a common base ring `R`, and `A` and `B` both have the `S‚ÇÅ`-module topology. If the algebras
form scalar towers and the algebra map from  `S‚ÇÅ` to `B` factors through `e`, and if `A` and `B`
are equivalent as `S‚ÇÇ`-algebras, then they are topologically equivalent as `S‚ÇÇ`-algebras as well
(even though they do not necessarily have the `S‚ÇÇ`-module topologies).

In application this is used for a situation where we have
```
v.Completion    L
         \    /
          \  /
           K
```
for an infinite place `v` of a number field `K`. We have an `L`-algebra equivalence
`L ‚äó[K] v.Completion ‚âÉ‚Çê[L] Œ† (w : v.ExtensionPlace L), wv.1.Completion`
between `v.Completion`-module topological spaces. And so this allows us to assert that this
is a _continuous_ `L`-algebra equivalence as well.
