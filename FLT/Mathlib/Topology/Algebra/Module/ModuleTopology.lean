# An "action topology" for modules over a topological ring

If `R` is a topological group (or even just a topological space) acting on an additive
abelian group `A`, we define the *action topology* to be the finest topology on `A`
making `• : R × A → A` and `+ : A × A → A` continuous (with all the products having the
product topology).

This topology was suggested by Will Sawin [here](https://mathoverflow.net/a/477763/1384).

## Mathematical details

A crucial observation is that if `M` is a topological `R`-module, if `A` is an `R`-module with no
topology, and if `φ : A → M` is linear, then the pullback of `M`'s topology to `A` is a topology
making `A` into a topological module. Let's for example check that `•` is continuous.
If `U ⊆ A` is open then by definition of the pullback topology, `U = φ⁻¹(V)` for some open `V ⊆ M`,
and now the pullback of `U` under `•` is just the pullback along the continuous map
`id × φ : R × A → R × M` of the preimage of `V` under the continuous map `• : R × M → M`,
so it's open. The proof for `+` is similar.

As a consequence of this, we see that if `φ : A → M` is a linear map between topological `R`-modules
modules and if `A` has the action topology, then `φ` is automatically continuous.
Indeed the argument above shows that if `A → M` is linear then the action
topology on `A` is `≤` the pullback of the action topology on `M` (because it's the inf of a set
containing this topology) which is the definition of continuity.

We also deduce that the action topology is a functor from the category of `R`-modules
(`R` a topological ring) to the category of topological `R`-modules, and it is perhaps
unsurprising that this is an adjoint to the forgetful functor. Indeed, if `A` is an `R`-module
and `M` is a topological `R`-module, then the previous paragraph shows that
the linear maps `A → M` are precisely the continuous linear maps
from (`A` with its action topology) to `M`, so the action topology is a left adjoint
to the forgetful functor.

This file develops the theory of the action topology. We prove that the action topology on
`R` as a module over itself is `R`'s original topology, that the action topology on a product
of modules is the product of the action topologies, and that the action topology on a quotient
module is the quotient topology.

We also show the slightly more subtle result that if `M`, `N` and `P` are `R`-modules
equipped with the action topology and if furthermore `M` is finite as an `R`-module,
then any bilinear map `M × N → P` is continuous.

As a consequence of this, we deduce that if `R` is a commutative topological ring
and `A` is an `R`-algebra of finite type as `R`-module, then `A` with its module
topology becomes a topological ring (i.e., multiplication is continuous).

## TODO

1) add the statement that the action topology is a functor from the category of `R`-modules
to the category of topological `R`-modules, and prove it's an adjoint

2) PRs to mathlib:

2a) weaken ring to semiring in some freeness statements in mathlib and then weaken
the corresponding statements in this file

2b) PR `induced_sInf`, `induced_continuous_smul`, `induced_continuous_add`,
  `isOpenMap_of_coinduced`, `LinearEquiv.sumPiEquivProdPi` and whatever else I use here.
