# Assumptions

The initial goal of this project (hopefully to be attained by September 2029,
the period of the EPSRC funding) is to reduce Fermat's Last Theorem
to various mathematical results which were known in the 1980s.
This directory `FLT/Assumptions` contains formal statements of these
assumptions. More will be added as the project progresses;
some of the assumptions we need cannot even be stated until we formalize
more definitions.

Anybody (humans, AI) is welcome to work on formalizing the proofs of these
assumptions; this task is not high priority for the project at this point. For now,
my focus is on proving FLT modulo these assumptions. To avoid duplication,
anyone proposing to work on an assumption should consider indicating this
on the github issue associated to the assumption.

Each file in this directory contains one `axiom`. The `axiom` corresponds
to a theorem which was in the published mathematical literature
by 31st December 1989. The file contains a precise reference to the
literature where the theorem is proved.

## Formalized assumptions

We give a brief summary of each file in this directory.

* `Odlyzko.lean` : an "Odlyzko bound" for root discriminants. Issue [#458](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/issues/458).

* `Mazur.lean` : Mazur's bounds for the torsion of an elliptic curve over the rationals.
  Issue [#477](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/issues/477).

## Formalizable assumptions

The statements of the bassumptions below are probably formalizable with the definitions
that we have, but nobody did them yet.

* Existence of a solvable extension of a number field with prescribed behaviour
at a finite set of places (the proof uses class field theory).

* Moret-Bailly's theorem (existence of global points on curves with prescribed
local properties).

## Forthcoming assumptions

The assumptions below cannot yet be stated because of missing definitions.

The next definition needs Hecke algebras.

* The existence of a p-adic Galois representation attached to a weight 2 automorphic
  form over a totally definite quaternion algebra.

The next three assumptions need definitions of automorphic representations.
Note that to do the classification of image for cyclic base change we might well also
need multiplicity 1 for GL_2, which could be a separate project.

* Automorphic induction from GL_1 to GL_2 (e.g. "CM elliptic curves are modular")

* Cyclic base change for GL_2 and classification of image

* The Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between GL_2 and automorphic forms on totally definite
  quaternion algebras.

I will probably rephrase all of these goals in terms of Galois representations which will
avoid us having to define automorphic forms for GL_2 directly.

The next assumption can't be stated yet because we don't have Galois cohomology.
This is work in progress by Livingston, Yang and Hill.

* Poitou-Tate (aka the "Greenberg-Wiles long exact sequence")
