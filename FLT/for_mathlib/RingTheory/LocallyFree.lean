/-! # Locally free modules
Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $M$ be an $R$-module. We say that $M$ is *locally free* if
there exist $f_1, \ldots, f_n \in R$, which generate the unit ideal, such that the localization
$M_{f_i}$ is a free $R_{f_i}$-module for all $i$.

We say that $M$ is *locally free of finite rank* if there exist $f_1, \ldots, f_n \in R$, which
generate the unit ideal, such that $M_{f_i}$ is a free $R_{f_i}$-module of finite rank for all $i$.

The main result of this file is [Lemma 10.78.2](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00NV) of the
Stacks project, which states that the following are equivalent:

1. $M$ is finitely presented and flat.
2. $M$ is finitely generated and projective.
3. $M$ is a direct summand of a free $R$-module of finite rank.
4. $M$ is finitely presented and stalkwise free (i.e. $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a free
$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$-module for all prime ideals $\mathfrak{p} \subset R$).
5. $M$ is finitely presented and $M_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a free $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$-module for all
maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m} \subset R$.
6. $M$ is finitely generated and locally free.
7. $M$ is locally free of finite rank.
8. $M$ is finitely generated and stalkwise free, and the rank of $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ over
$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is Zariski-locally constant.

## TODO
- Notation for $R_f$ and $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$
- "Finitely presented" as a predicate
- Localization is exact
- Projectiveness is a local property
- Flatness is a local property
- Direct sum of two modules / split short exact sequences
- Actually prove the lemma
