# Characteristic predicate for central simple algebras

In this file we define the predicate `IsCentralSimple K D` where `K` is a field
and `D` is a (noncommutative) `K`-algebra.

Note that the predicate makes sense just for `K` a `CommRing` but it doesn't give the
right definition; for a commutative ring base one should use the theory of Azumaya algebras.
This adds an extra layer of complication which we don't need. In fact ideals of `K`
immediately give rise to nontrivial quotients of `D` so there are no central simple
algebras in this case according to our definition.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{IsCentralSimple.baseChange}
    If $D$ is a central simple algebra over~$K$ and $L/K$ is a field extension, then $L\otimes_KD$
    is a central simple algebra over~$L$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This is not too hard: it's lemma b of section 12.4 in Peirce's "Associative algebras".
    Will maybe write more on Saturday.
\end{proof}
