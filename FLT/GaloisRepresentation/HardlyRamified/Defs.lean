# Hardly ramified representations

Let `R` be a complete local Noetherian ring with residue charactestic `p>2` (or a slightly
more general class of topological ring) and let
$\rho:Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})\to GL_2(R)$ be a continuous Galois
representation. We say that `ρ` is *hardly ramified* if it has cyclotomic determinant, is
unramified outside `2p`, is flat at `p` and (possibly after conjugation) is
upper-triangular at 2 with unramified quotient of order 1 or 2.

The reason this definition is useful to us is that the `p`-torsion in the Frey
curve is hardly ramified (this is standard, although the full proof is long and needs the
theory of the Tate curve, as well as many standard facts about elliptic curves such as the
Weil pairing). Serre's conjecture says that such a representation cannot be irreducible
(as it should be modular of weight 2 and level 2).

Furthermore, mod `p` hardly ramified representations can be lifted to characteristic zero,
and `p`-adic hardly ramified representations can be put into compatible families (these are
hard theorems). Finally, 3-adic hardly ramified representations can be classified
(this is also a hard theorem).

## More details

Say `ℓ ≥ 3` is a prime, `k` is a finite field of characteristic `ℓ` and `R` is a projective
limit of Artin local rings with residue field `k` along local ring maps which induce
the identity on `k`. Give the Artin local rings the discrete topology and `R` the
projective limit topology, so that `R` is profinite.

Let `V` be an `R`-module, free of rank 2 and with the product topology
(i.e., the `R`-module topology). A representation `ρ : G_Q → GL_R(V)` is said to be
*hardly ramified* if

1) `det ρ` is the mod `ℓ` cyclotomic character;
2) `ρ` is unramified outside `2ℓ`;
3) `ρ|_{G_ℓ}` is flat (this means that for every open ideal `I` of `R`, the representation
`G_Q → GL_(R/I)(V/I)` come from finite flat group schemes; note that `V/I` is a finite set); and
4) there is a `G_2`-stable exact sequence `0 → K → V → W → 0` with `K` and `W` `R`-free of
rank 1, and where `ρ` acts on `W` via an unramified character whose square is trivial.
