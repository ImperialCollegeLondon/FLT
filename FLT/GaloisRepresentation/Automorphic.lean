# Automorphic Galois representations

For our proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, the following definition is the most convenient.

We say that a 2-dimensional $p$-adic or a mod $p$ Galois representation of the absolute
Galois of a totally real field number field $F$ of even degree is *automorphic* if there
exists a totally definite quaternion algebra $D/F$ unramified at all finite places,
a finite set $S$ of finite places of $F$, and an automorphic form of level $U_1(S)$
(matrices congruent to $(a *;0 a)$ mod $v$ for all $v\in S$) and weight 2 for $D$
such that the Galois representation is associated to the form by the construction of
Carayol, Taylor et al.

## Notes

Several things here are specialized to our case. We demand that the quaternion algebra is
unramified everywhere because this is the only case that we need. We stick to weight 2
because this is the only case that we need. The level is also more restrictive but again
the only thing we need: the automorphic forms it catches are trivial at all infinite places
and at all finite places are either Steinberg or principal series `π(χ₁, χ₂)` with `χᵢ` tame
and `χ₁χ₂` unramified.

A 2-dimensional Galois representation `ρ` of the absolute Galois group of a totally
real field of even degree is said to be automorphic if it comes from a weight 2 trivial
character square-free level automorphic form on a totally definite quaternion algebra
of discriminant 1. More precisely, the level at each bad prime v has to be of the form
(a *;0 a) mod v.

This is a far more restrictive definition of automorphic than is found in the literature,
however it will suffice for the purpose of proving FLT.

Cyclic base change.

Let `E/F` be a finite solvable extension of totally real fields of even degree,
let `p>2` be a prime and let `ρ : Gal(F-bar/F) -> GL_2(Q_p-bar)` be a continuous representation,
which is irreducible even when restricted to `Gal(E-bar/E)`. Let `S` be a finite
set of finite places of `F`, not dividing `p`.

Suppose furthermore
* `ρ` unramified outside `S` and `p`;
* `ρ` descends to `ρ₀ : Gal(F-bar/F) -> GL_2(R)` with `R ⊆ ℚ_p-bar` a subring finite
  free over ℤ_p, and `ρ₀` is flat at all places of F dividing `p`;
* If `v ∈ S` then the restriction of `ρ` to `Fᵥ` has a rank one tame quotient;
* `det(ρ)` is the cyclotomic character.

Then `ρ` is automorphic of level U₁(S) iff ρ|G_E is automorphic of level U₁(S_E),
where S_E is the pullback of S to E.
