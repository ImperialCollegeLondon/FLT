# Flat Galois modules: finite flat group schemes over a DVR, Hopf-algebraically

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions `K`, and let `Kˢᵉᵖ` be a
separable closure of `K`. This file concerns actions of `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)` on finite abelian
groups (given as functions `ρ : (Kˢᵉᵖ ≃ₐ[K] Kˢᵉᵖ) → M ≃+ M`, with multiplicativity
hypothesised where needed), and what it
means for such an action to be *flat*: mathlib has no group schemes, so we say throughout
"commutative Hopf algebra, finite flat as a module" for "affine group scheme, finite flat
over the base".

## Main definitions

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsContinuous ρ` : every element of `M` is fixed by the
  subgroup fixing some finite subextension of `Kˢᵉᵖ/K`. (This is continuity of the action
  for the Krull topology on the Galois group and the discrete topology on `M`.)

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsUnramified R ρ` : for every valuation subring `𝒪` of `Kˢᵉᵖ`
  lying above `R`, the inertia subgroup at `𝒪` acts trivially on `M`.

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsFlat R ρ` : there is a commutative Hopf algebra `H` over
  `R`, finite and flat as an `R`-module (over the DVR `R` this means finite free; it is
  the Hopf algebra of functions on a finite flat group scheme over `R`), whose generic
  fibre `K ⊗[R] H` is étale over `K`, together with an isomorphism of groups from the
  `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points `K ⊗[R] H →ₐ[K] Kˢᵉᵖ` of the generic fibre (a group under convolution) to
  `M`, equivariant for the `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)`-actions on the two sides. This is the definition
  promised in the TODO of `FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.Flat`, and the conclusion of
  `WeierstrassCurve.torsion_flat_of_good_reduction` is exactly
  `IsFlat R (torsion action on E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n])`, unfolded.

## Main statements

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsFlat.prod` (proved) : flat ⊓ flat = flat for a product of two
  Galois modules; the underlying Hopf algebra is the tensor product `H₁ ⊗[R] H₂` (whose Hopf
  algebra structure is already in mathlib, `Mathlib.RingTheory.HopfAlgebra.TensorProduct`),
  and the point is that `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points of a tensor product are pairs of `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points,
  compatibly with convolution.

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsFlat.congr` (proved) : flatness transports along an equivariant
  isomorphism of Galois modules; more of this formal API can be added as needed (e.g. flatness
  of sub/quotient modules via schematic closure, which is the hard Raynaud-style direction and
  is *not* formal).

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsFlat.of_isUnramified` (proved modulo the sorried descent
  helper below) : a continuous unramified action on a finite abelian group is flat; indeed
  it prolongs to a finite *étale* group scheme over `R`. This is pure descent/Galois
  theory, with no elliptic curves anywhere. The Galois-theoretic reduction
  (`exists_finiteGalois_of_isContinuous`: the action factors through a finite Galois
  subextension `L/K`) is proved.

## Main statements (currently sorried)

* `GroupScheme.GaloisModule.IsFlat.of_finiteGalois_unramified` : the Galois-descent core.
  Given the finite Galois `L/K` through which the action factors, unramifiedness lets one
  produce the prolongation: `H` is the algebra of `Gal(L/K)`-invariant functions `M → R'`,
  where `R'` is the integral closure of `R` in `L` (finite étale over `R` because `L/K`
  is unramified and `R` is a DVR); its Hopf structure is pointwise multiplication, with
  comultiplication dual to the addition of `M`. See [Tate, *Finite flat group schemes*,
  in *Modular forms and Fermat's Last Theorem*, §1.3–1.4] or [Waterhouse, *Introduction
  to affine group schemes*, §6].

## TODO

* Prove the one remaining sorried statement, `IsFlat.of_finiteGalois_unramified`.

pins the generic fibre down as the finite étale group scheme attached to the Galois module
`M`; it is automatic in characteristic zero by Cartier's theorem), and the group

Galois subextension `L/K` of `Kˢᵉᵖ/K` such that the subgroup of `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)` fixing `L`
acts trivially on all of `M`. Concretely, one takes the compositum of the finitely many
finite subextensions provided by continuity (one per element of `M`) and passes to its
normal closure, which is finite (as a compositum of finitely many finite extensions) and
Galois (as the normal closure of a separable extension inside the Galois extension
`Kˢᵉᵖ/K`).

This is pure Galois theory and involves neither `R` nor the ring `M`-structure. -/

subgroup at every valuation subring of `Kˢᵉᵖ` lying above `R` fixes `L` pointwise (i.e. the
inertia is contained in the subgroup fixing `L`). Equivalently, the integral closure of `R`
in `L` is unramified — indeed finite étale, `R` being a DVR — over `R`.

This is a property of the extension `L/K` only (it does not involve the module `M`); it is

/-- **The unramified-kernel-field reduction (pure Galois/ramification theory).** Given a
finite Galois subextension `L/K` through which the action `ρ` factors, and given that `ρ` is
unramified over `R`, one may *shrink* `L` to a finite Galois subextension `L'/K` that still
carries the action and is itself unramified over `R`.

Concretely, take `L'` to be the fixed field of the kernel `{σ : ρ σ = 1}` of the action —
a subgroup of `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)` containing the (open) fixing subgroup of `L`, hence itself the
fixing subgroup of a finite subextension `L' ⊆ L`, and normal because the kernel of an action
on an abelian group is normal, so `L'/K` is Galois. The action factors through `Gal(L'/K)` by
construction, and `IsUnramified R ρ` says inertia acts trivially on `M`, i.e. inertia lies in
the kernel `= L'.fixingSubgroup`; thus `L'/K` is unramified over `R`. This is exactly the
point that `L` itself need not be unramified — only the subextension through which `ρ`
genuinely factors is. Pure Galois theory, no elliptic curves, no ring structure on `M`.

/-- **Steps B–D: Galois descent of the finite étale group scheme (deep, not yet
formalised).** Given a finite Galois subextension `L/K` of `Kˢᵉᵖ/K` whose fixing subgroup
acts trivially on the finite module `M`, and given that `L/K` *itself* is unramified over the
DVR `R` (`IsUnramifiedExtension R L`), the module is flat. This is the unramified-extension
case: the reduction to it from a merely unramified *action* is
`exists_isUnramifiedExtension`.

This packages the genuinely hard part of the construction, which has three ingredients
(none involving elliptic curves):

* **(B) the generic fibre.** The `K`-Hopf algebra of `Gal(L/K)`-invariant functions
  `(M → L)^{Gal(L/K)}` (for the action `σ · f = σ ∘ f ∘ ρ(σ)⁻¹`), with pointwise algebra
  structure and comultiplication dual to the addition of `M`; it is finite étale over `K`
  as a Galois-twisted form of `M → K`, and its `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points recover `M` equivariantly.

* **(C) the integral model.** The integral closure `R'` of `R` in `L` is finite étale over
  `R` — here the DVR hypothesis on `R` and unramifiedness of `L/K` over `R` are used — so
  `H := (M → R')^{Gal(L/K)}` is finite flat (indeed finite étale) over `R` with generic
  fibre the algebra of (B).

* **(D) assembly.** Package `H` as the required Hopf algebra and prove the equivariant
  additive equivalence on `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points.

/-- **A continuous unramified Galois module is flat.** If `M` is a finite abelian group
and the action `ρ` of `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)` on `M` is continuous and unramified over `R`, then it
prolongs to a finite flat — indeed finite étale — group scheme over `R`.

Proof sketch (pure Galois theory / descent, no elliptic curves): by continuity and
finiteness of `M` the action factors through `Gal(L/K)` for some finite Galois
subextension `L/K` of `Kˢᵉᵖ/K`, and by unramifiedness `L/K` may be chosen unramified over
`R`. Let `R'` be the integral closure of `R` in `L`, a finite étale `R`-algebra (here
unramifiedness of `L/K` and `R` being a DVR are used). Take `H` to be the
`Gal(L/K)`-invariants of the algebra of functions `M → R'`, where `Gal(L/K)` acts on both
`M` and `R'`; pointwise multiplication makes `H` a commutative `R`-algebra, finite étale
because it is a Galois-twisted form of `M → R`, and the comultiplication dual to addition
`M × M → M` makes it a Hopf algebra. Its `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points recover `M` equivariantly:
evaluation at the `Kˢᵉᵖ`-embeddings of `R'` splits the twist. -/
