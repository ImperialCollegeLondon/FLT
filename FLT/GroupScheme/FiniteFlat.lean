Def of what it means for a Hopf algebra to be finite locally free.
Proof that if the base is Noetherian then this is the same as flat.

If K is a field then definition of Hopf algebra attached to an
action of Gal(K^sep/K) on a finite abelian group A. There is a duality
here: the answer is either that it's the Galois-invariant functions A->K^{sep}
with some Hopf algebra structure, or it's the dual of this.

If K is fof(DVR) then def of what it means for an action of Gal(K^sep/K)
on a finite abelian group to be flat.
