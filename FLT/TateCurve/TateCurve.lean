Need Tate uniformisation from Silverman 2 Ch 5. Don't need surjectivity.
May as well work over a general field complete wrt a nontrivial nonarch norm.

Key result needed: Galois action on Qpbar-points of p-torsion of elliptic curve E
over Qp is isomorphic to some explicit quotient of Qpbar^* by q(E)^â„¤.

One of the hardest parts of the argument is surjectivity; we don't need it so I propose
we skip it. This enables the entire argument to be run over a field complete with respect
to a nontrivial nonarchimedean real-valued norm.

Key thing we want: injection from K^* / <q> into E(K) where K is a field complete wrt
a nontriv nonarch norm, E is the Frey curve and q is chosen appropriately; proof that the injection
is functorial in the sense that if K -> L
is an injection of fields and the norm on L restricts to the norm on K then the obvious
diagram commutes.
