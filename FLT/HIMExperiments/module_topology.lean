# The "module topology" for a module over a topological ring.

Let `A` denote a topological ring.

If `M` is an `A`-module, then `M` seems to inherit a topology from `A`, which we call the
"module topology" until someone tells me its proper name. It's the coarsest topology
making all the `A`-linear maps `M →ₗ[A] A` continuous.

This topology has the following cool properties:

1) Any `A`-linear map `φ : M →ₗ[A] N` is continuous for the module topologies on source
and target.

2)
