# An "action topology" for monoid actions.

If `R` is a topological monoid and `A` is a type with an `R`-action,
then `A` inherits a topology from this set-up, which we call the *dual* topology.
It's the `≤`-biggest topology (i.e., the one with
the least open sets) making all `R`-maps `A → R` continuous.

In many cases this topology is the one you expect. For example if `R` is a topological field
and `A` is a finite-dimensional real vector space over `R` then picking a basis gives `A` a
product topology, and one can check that this is the action topology. Hence the product
topology on `A` is independent of choice of basis. **TODO** I haven't actually proved this.

## Overview

## NEEDS REWRITING

Let `R` denote a topological space, let `A` be a type (without
a topology, for now) and say `R` acts on `A`,
i.e., we're given `• : R × A → A`. In applications `R` might
be a topological monoid and `A` an abelian group with an action of `R`.
Or `R` might be a topological ring, for example the reals, and `A` an `R`-module
or an `R`-algebra.

There are now at least two ways of inducing a topology on `A`
(in the module over a ring situation, at least three ways).
One could demand that `(· • a)` is continuous for all `a : A`, for example,
and put the universal topology for this property on `A`.
In the module case one could demand that all `R`-linear maps `A →ₗ[R] R`
are continuous. But the definition here is one proposed by Yury
Kudryashov. He pointed out that if `τᵢ : TopologicalSpace A` all make
the action maps `R × A → A` continuous, then the `Inf` of the `τᵢ`
also has this property. This means that there is a smallest (in the `≤` sense,
i.e. the most open sets) topology on `A` such that `• : R × A → A` is
continuous. We call topology the *action topology*. It is some kind
of "pushforward topology" on `A` coming from the `R`-action, but
it is not a pushforward in the `f_*` sense of the word because
there is no fixed `f : R → A`.

## Basic properties

**NOTHING PROVED**

We fix a type `R` with a topology, and we let it act on things. We say an *R*-type
is a type `A` equipped with `SMul R A`.

0) (Unit) `Unit` is an `R`-type with the trivial action, action topology is the given topology on `Unit`
(because there is only one topology on `Unit`)

1) (Id) If `R` is a topological monoid (so `*` is continuous) then `R` becomes an `R`-type via `*`,
and the action topology agrees with `R`'s original topology.

2) (Functions) If `A` and `B` are `R`-types with the action topologies, then any `R`-equivariant map
`φ : A →[R] B` is automatically continuous.

3) (Prod) The action topology on a product `A × B` of `R`-types is the product of the action
topologies **NOT YET PROVED, MAY NOT BE TRUE**

4) (Pi): The action topology on an indexed product of `R`-types is the product topology
**NOT YET PROVED, MAY NOT BE TRUE**

5) (Sigma) The action topology on `Σ i, A i` is whatever topology mathlib has on this
**NOT YET PROVED, MAY NOT BE TRUE**

Now say `R` is a commutative topological ring. **NOTHING BELOW HERE IS PROVED YET**

6) Say `A`, `B` are `R`-modules with their
action topology. Then the tensor product `A ⊗[R] B` is also an `R`-module.
and so we can ask if the canonical bilinear map from `A × B` (with the action or product topology?
probably they're the same) to `A ⊗[R] B` is continuous.

7) Commutativity of `R` also gives spaces of `R`-linear maps the structure of `R`-modules,
so we can ask for example whether the function application map `A × (A →ₗ[R] B) → B` is continuous.

8) We could also ask whether the evaluation map, from `A →ₗ[R] B` to the power space `B^A` of bare
functions from `A` (now considered only as an index set, so with no topology) to `B` is continuous.
