\chapter{Reducibility of {\it p}-torsion of the Frey curve}\label{ch_freyreduction}

\section{Overview}

In chapter~\ref{ch_reductions} we reduced FLT, modulo a hard theorem from the 1970s,
to Theorem~\ref{FLT.Wiles_Frey}, the assertion that $p$-torsion in the Frey
curve is reducible. In this chapter we deduce this assertion from three more complex claims
about ``hardly ramified'' Galois representations. It is relatively straightforward
to reduce one of these claims to a result of Fontaine proved in the 1980s in his
paper on the nonexistence of nontrivial abelian schemes over $\Z$. The other two
claims lie deeper, and their proofs use techniques initially developed by Wiles in
the 1990s.

\section{Hardly ramified representations}

Let $(a,b,c,p)$ be a Frey package (so in particular $p\geq5$ is prime and $a^p+b^p=c^p$),
let $E$ be the corresponding Frey curve over $\Q$, and let $\rho:\GQ\to\Aut(E(\Qbar)[p])$
be the 2-dimensional Galois representation on the $p$-torsion of~$E$. Recall that our goal
is to prove that $\rho$ is reducible.

What we need to leverage is the fact that $\rho$ has very little ramification. To give
a toy example before we start: if $K$ is a number field (i.e., a finite extension of $\Q$)
and if the extension $K/\Q$ is unramified at all primes, then an old theorem of
Minkowski tells us that $K=\Q$. We want to prove a theorem in a similar vein; if
a 2-dimensional mod $p$ Galois representation is hardly ramified, then it is reducible.
Below, we give a precise
definition of what it means for a 2-dimensional representation $\GQ\to\GL_2(R)$
to be hardly ramified. Before we do that, we need to say precisely which rings~$R$
we will allow. We recall the following definition, due to Grothendieck:

\begin{definition}
  \label{pseudocompact}
  A commutative topological ring~$R$ is \emph{pseudocompact} if it satisfies
  the following properties:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $U\subseteq R$ is any open set containing 0, then there's an open ideal $I\subseteq U$.
    \item If $I\subseteq R$ is an open ideal, then $R/I$ is Artinian.
    \item The natural map $R\to\lim_{\leftarrow} R/I$ is a topological and algebraic isomorphism, where $I$ runs
      over the open ideals of $R$. Here $R/I$ has the discrete topology and the projective
      limit has the projective limit topology.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{coefficient-ring}
  \uses{pseudocompact}
  A \emph{coefficient ring} is a local pseudocompact topological ring $R$ with
  finite residue field.
\end{definition}

Equivalently, a coefficient ring is a local profinite topological ring with finite
residue field. Examples of coefficient rings include finite fields, and integer rings of finite extensions
of $\Q_p$. There are also non-Noetherian examples, for example the projective limit over $n$ of
the rings $\Z/p\Z[\varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_n]/(\forall i,j,\varepsilon_i\varepsilon_j=0)$;
these rings are convenient to include
for technical reasons. If $R$ is a coefficient ring with maximal ideal $\m$
and residue field $k$ of characteristic~$\ell>0$, then for any open ideal~$I$ there is
a ring homomorphism $\Z/\ell^n\Z\to R/I$ for all sufficiently large naturals $n$,
and thus a continuous ring homomorphism $\Z_{\ell}\to R$. The $\ell$-adic cyclotomic character
is a continuous
representation $\GQ\to\Z_{\ell}^\times$ and it thus induces a continuous
representation $\GQ\to R^\times$ which we also refer to as the cyclotomic character.

\begin{definition}
  \label{hardly_ramified}
  \uses{coefficient-ring}
  Let $R$ be a coefficient ring with finite residue field of characteristic $\ell\geq3$.
  Let $V$ be a finite free $R$-module of rank~2, equipped with the product topology. A
  continuous representation $\rho: \GQ\to \GL_R(V)$ is said to be \emph{hardly ramified} if it
  satisfies the following four conditions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\det(\rho):\GQ\to R^\times$ is the cyclotomic character;
  \item $\rho$ is unramified outside $2\ell$;
  \item The restriction of $\rho$ to $\Gal(\Qbar_2/\Q_2)$ is reducible (more precisely,
  there is a short exact sequence $0\to R\to V\to R\to 0$ which is stable
  under the action of $\Gal(\Qbar_2/\Q_2)$) and the Galois action on the 1-dimensional
  quotient is an unramified representation of $\Gal(\Qbar_2/\Q_2)$ whose square is trivial;
  \item The restriction of $\rho$ to $\GQl$ is flat, by which we mean that for all open
  ideals $I$ of $R$, the (finite image) representation $\rho$ mod $I:\GQl\to \GL_{R/I}(V/I)$
  comes from a finite flat group scheme.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

A well-known result, which basically goes back to Frey, is the following:

\begin{theorem}
  \label{Frey_curve_hardly_ramified}
  \uses{hardly_ramified}
  The $\ell$-torsion $\rho:\GQ\to\GL_2(\Z/\ell\Z)$ in the Frey curve associated to a Frey
  package $(a,b,c,\ell)$ is hardly ramified.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  This was well-known in the 1980s. A proof sketch is as follows.
  First note that $\ell\geq5>3$ by definition of a Frey package. Let $\rho$
  denote the Galois representation on the $\ell$-torsion of the Frey curve.
  The fact that $\rho$ is 2-dimensional is~Corollary
  III.6.4(b) of~\cite{silverman1}, and the fact that its determinant is
  cyclotomic is Proposition~III.8.3 of the same reference. These results hold for elliptic curves
  in general. The remaining claims are specific to the Frey curve and lie
  deeper. The fact that $\rho$ is unramified outside $2\ell$ is a consequence
  of (4.1.12) and (4.1.13) of~\cite{serreconj}. The fact that $\rho$ at 2
  has an unramified 1-dimensional quotient of order at most 2 follows from
  the fact that the Frey curve is semistable at~2 (see (4.1.5) of~\cite{serreconj})
  and the theory of the Tate curve. Finally, the claim that $\rho$ is flat at $\ell$
  is Proposition~5 and (4.1.13) of~\cite{serreconj}.
\end{proof}

The key theorem about hardly ramified representations is the following.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{hardly_ramified_reducible}
  If $\ell\geq 3$ is a prime and $\rho:\GQ\to\GL_2(\Z/\ell\Z)$ is hardly ramified,
  then $\rho$ is reducible.
\end{theorem}

Note that this (deep) claim is a consequence of Serre's conjecture~\cite{serreconj},
now a theorem of Khare and Wintenberger~\cite{kwII}, and indeed we shall use
methods introduced by Khare and Wintenberger to prove this special case of
Serre's conjecture. Given this result, we can deduce Theorem~\ref{FLT.Wiles_Frey}
(which we restate here) easily:

\begin{theorem}
  \label{FLT.Wiles_Frey'}
  \lean{FLT.Wiles_Frey}
  \leanok
  If $\overline{\rho}$ is the mod $p$ Galois representation associated to a Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$ then
  $\overline{\rho}$ is reducible.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{Frey_curve_hardly_ramified,hardly_ramified_reducible}
  Indeed, $\rho$ is hardly ramified by theorem~\ref{Frey_curve_hardly_ramified}
  and thus reducible by theorem~\ref{hardly_ramified_reducible}.
\end{proof}

Our job, in the first phase of this project, is hence reduced to proving
Theorem~\ref{hardly_ramified_reducible}.

\subsection{Hardly ramified mod $p$ representations are reducible}

In this section we will state three theorems, from which Theorem~\ref{hardly_ramified_reducible}
easily follows.

Firstly, we claim that
an irreducible hardly ramified mod $\ell$ representation lifts to an $\ell$-adic representation.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{hardly-ramified-lifts}
  \uses{hardly-ramified}
  If $\ell\geq3$ is prime and $\overline{\rho}:\GQ\to\GL_2(\Z/\ell\Z)$
  is hardly ramified and irreducible, then there exists a finite extension~$K$ of $\Q_\ell$
  with integer ring~$\calO$ and maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$
  and a hardly ramified representation
  $\rho:\GQ\to\GL_2(\calO)$ whose reduction modulo~$\m$ is isomorphic to $\rho$.
\end{theorem}

Next we claim that a hardly ramified $\ell$-adic representation ``spreads out'' to a compatible
family of hardly ramified $q$-adic representations for all primes $q$.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{hardly-ramified-spreads-out}
  \uses{hardly-ramified}
  If $\ell\geq3$ is prime, $K$ is a finite extension of $\Q_\ell$
  with integers $\calO$ and if $\rho:\GQ\to\GL_2(\calO)$ is a hardly ramified representation
  whose reduction is irreducible,
  then there exists a number field $M$ and, for each finite place $\mu$ of $M$
  of characteristic prime to 2, with completion $M_\mu$ having integer ring $R_\mu$,
  a hardly representation $\rho_\mu:\GQ\to\GL_2(R_\mu)$, with the following properties:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There is some $\lambda\mid\ell$ of $M$ such that $\rho_\lambda\cong\rho$,
      the isomorphism happening over some appropriate local field containing a copy
      of $M_\lambda$ and a copy of~$K$;
    \item If $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are two finite places of $M$ with odd characteristics $m_1$
      and $m_2$, and if $p\nmid 2m_1m_2$ is prime, then $\rho_{\mu_1}$ and $\rho_{\mu_2}$
      are both unramified at~$p$ and the characteristic polynomials $\rho_{\mu_1}(\Frob_p)$
      and $\rho_{\mu_2}(\Frob_p)$ lie in $M[X]$ and are equal.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

In particular, we can ``move'' from an irreducible hardly ramified mod $\ell$ representation
to a hardly ramified 3-adic representation.
However, we can essentially completely classify the hardly ramified 3-adic Galois representations.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{hardly-ramified-3adic-reducible}
  \uses{hardly-ramified}
  Suppose $L/\Q_3$ is a finite extension, with integer ring $\calO_L$, and suppose
  $\rho_3:\GQ\to\GL_2(\calO_L)$ is hardly ramified. Then $\rho_3^{ss}=1\oplus\chi_3$
  where $1$ is the trivial character and $\chi_3$ is the 3-adic cyclotomic character.
\end{theorem}

Theorem~\ref{hardly_ramified_reducible} (if $\ell\geq 3$ is a prime and
$\overline{\rho}:\GQ\to\GL_2(\Z/\ell\Z)$ is hardly ramified,
then $\overline{\rho}$ is reducible) is an easy consequence of these theorems,
as we now show.

\begin{proof}
  \proves{hardly_ramified_reducible}
  \uses{hardly-ramified-lifts,
    hardly-ramified-spreads-out,hardly-ramified-3adic-reducible}
  Assume for a contradiction that $\overline{\rho}$ is irreducible. By theorem~\ref{hardly-ramified-lifts},
  $\overline{\rho}$ lifts to a hardly ramified $\ell$-adic reprepresentation $\rho$. By
  theorem~\ref{hardly-ramified-spreads-out}, $\rho$ is part of a compatible family of
  $q$-adic Galois representations. By theorem~\ref{hardly-ramified-3adic-reducible},
  any 3-adic member $\rho_3$ of this family has semisimplification $1\oplus\chi_3$ and in particular
  for $p\nmid 6$ we have that the characteristic polynomial of $\rho_3(\Frob_p)=(X-p)(X-1).$
  But by compatibility of the family we know that for $p\nmid 6\ell$ the characteristic
  polynomial of $\rho(\Frob_p)$ is $(X-p)(X-1)$, and thus the characteristic polynomial
  of $\overline{\rho}(\Frob_p)$ is $(X-p)(X-1)$. By the Brauer-Nesbitt theorem, $\overline{\rho}$
  is reducible, the contradiction we seek.
\end{proof}

What remains then (modulo several results which were known in the 1980s),
is to prove the three theorems~\ref{hardly-ramified-lifts},
\ref{hardly-ramified-spreads-out} and~\ref{hardly-ramified-3adic-reducible}.
By far the easiest is theorem~\ref{hardly-ramified-3adic-reducible}; this follows
from old estimates of Fontaine (ultimately relying on bounds for root discriminants due to
Odlyzko and Poitou), originally developed to prove that there was no
nontrivial abelian scheme over $\Z$. The other two theorems are deeper, and both use
modern variants of Wiles' $R=T$ machinery.

The story stops here for now; as we write more LaTeX it will become clear that here
the proof basically bifurcates, with different techniques used to prove
these three theorems.
