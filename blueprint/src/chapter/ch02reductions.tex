\chapter{First reductions of the problem}\label{ch_reductions}

\section{Overview}
The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is by contradiction. We assume that we have a counterexample
$a^n+b^n=c^n$, and manipulate it until it satisfies the axioms of a ``Frey package'', a basic
concept which we will explain below. From the
Frey package we build a Frey curve -- an elliptic curve defined over the rationals. We then look at
a certain representation of a Galois group coming from this elliptic curve, and finally using two
very deep and independent theorems (one due to Mazur, the other due to Wiles) we show that this
representation is neither reducible or irreducible, the contradiction we seek.

\section{Reduction to \texorpdfstring{$n\geq5$}{ngeq5} and prime}

\begin{lemma}\label{FermatLastTheorem.of_odd_primes}\lean{FermatLastTheorem.of_odd_primes}\leanok
  If there is a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem, then there is a counterexample $a^p+b^p=c^p$
  with $p$ an odd prime.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\leanok
  Note: this proof is \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/NumberTheory/FLT/Four.html#FermatLastTheorem.of_odd_primes}{in mathlib already};
  we run through it for completeness' sake.

  Say $a^n + b^n = c^n$ is a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem. Every positive integer is either
  a power of 2 or has an odd prime factor. If $n=kp$ has an odd prime factor $p$ then
  $(a^k)^p+(b^k)^p=(c^k)^p$ is the counterexample we seek. It remains to deal with the case where
  $n$ is a power of 2, so let's assume this. We have $3\leq n$ by assumption, so
  $n=4k$ must be a multiple of~4, and thus $(a^k)^4=(b^k)^4=(c^k)^4$, giving us a counterexample
  to Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=4$. However an old result of Fermat himself (proved as
  \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/NumberTheory/FLT/Four.html#fermatLastTheoremFour}{\tt fermatLastTheoremFour}
  in {\tt mathlib}) says that $x^4+y^4=z^4$ has no solutions in positive integers.
\end{proof}

Euler proved Fermat's Last Theorem for $p=3$;

\begin{lemma}\label{fermatLastTheoremThree}\lean{fermatLastTheoremThree}\leanok
\discussion{16}
  There are no solutions in positive integers to $a^3+b^3=c^3$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  The proof in mathlib was formalized by a team from the ``Lean For the Curious Mathematician'' conference held in Luminy in March 2024
  (its dependency graph can be visualised \href{https://pitmonticone.github.io/FLT3/blueprint/dep_graph_document.html}{\underline{here}}).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{FLT.of_p_ge_5}\lean{FLT.of_p_ge_5}\leanok If there is a counterexample to
  Fermat's Last Theorem, then there is a counterexample $a^p+b^p=c^p$ with $p$ prime and $p\geq 5$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}\uses{fermatLastTheoremThree, FermatLastTheorem.of_odd_primes}\leanok Follows from the
  previous two lemmas.\end{proof}

\section{Frey packages}

For convenience we make the following definition.

\begin{definition}\label{FLT.FreyPackage}\lean{FLT.FreyPackage}\leanok A \emph{Frey package} $(a,b,c,p)$
is three nonzero pairwise-coprime integers $a$, $b$, $c$, with $a\equiv3\pmod4$ and $b\equiv0\pmod2$,
and a prime $p\geq5$, such that $a^p+b^p=c^p$.\end{definition}

Our next reduction is as follows:

\begin{lemma}\label{FLT.FreyPackage.of_not_FermatLastTheorem_p_ge_5}\lean{FLT.FreyPackage.of_not_FermatLastTheorem_p_ge_5}\leanok\discussion{19}
  If Fermat's Last Theorem is false for $p \ge 5$ and prime, then there exists a Frey package.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{FLT.FreyPackage}
  \leanok
  Suppose we have a counterexample $a^p+b^p=c^p$ for the given $p$; we now build a Frey package from this data.

  If the greatest common divisor of $a,b,c$ is $d$ then $a^p+b^p=c^p$ implies $(a/d)^p+(b/d)^p=(c/d)^p$.
  Dividing through, we can thus assume that no prime divides all of $a,b,c$. Under this assumption we
  must have that $a,b,c$ are pairwise coprime, as if some prime divides two of the integers $a,b,c$
  then by $a^p+b^p=c^p$ and unique factorization it must divide all three of them.
  In particular we may assume that not all of $a,b,c$ are even, and now reducing modulo~2 shows
  that precisely one of them must be even.

  Next we show that we can find a counterexample with $b$ even. If $a$ is the even one then we can
  just switch $a$ and $b$. If $c$ is the even one then we can replace $c$ by $-b$ and $b$ by $-c$
  (using that $p$ is odd).

  The last thing to ensure is that $a$ is 3 mod~4. Because $b$ is even, we know that $a$ is odd,
  so it is either~1 or~3 mod~4. If $a$ is 3 mod~4 then we are home; if however $a$ is 1 mod~4 we
  replace $a,b,c$ by their negatives and this is the Frey package we seek.
\end{proof}

\section{Galois representations and elliptic curves}\label{twopointfour}

To continue, we need some of the theory of elliptic curves over $\Q$. So let $f(X)$ denote any
monic cubic polynomial with rational coefficients and whose three complex roots are distinct,
and let us consider the equation $E:Y^2=f(X)$, which defines a curve in the $(X,Y)$ plane.
This curve (or strictly speaking its projectivisation) is a so-called elliptic curve
(or an elliptic curve over $\Q$ if we want to keep track of the field where the coefficients
of $f(X)$ lie).

If $E:Y^2=f(X)$ is an elliptic curve over $\Q$, and if $K$ is any characteristic zero field (and
hence a $\Q$-algebra), then we write $E(K)$ for the set of solutions to $y^2=f(x)$ with $x,y\in K$,
together with an additional ``point at infinity'' corresponding morally to $x=y=\infty$.
It is an extraordinary fact,
and not at all obvious, that $E(K)$ naturally has the structure of an additive abelian group,
with the point at infinity being the zero element (the identity). Fortunately this fact is
already in {\tt mathlib}. This additive group structure has
the property that three distinct points $P,Q,R\in K^2$ which are in $E(K)$ will sum to zero
if and only if they are collinear.

The group structure behaves well under change of field: if $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\Q$
and if $K\to L$ is a homomorphism of
characteristic zero fields then the induced map $E(K)\to E(L)$ is a group homomorphism.
Thus if $f:K\to L$ is an isomorphism of characteristic zero fields, the induced map $E(K)\to E(L)$
is an isomorphism of groups, with the inverse isomorphism being the map $E(L)\to E(K)$ induced
by $f^{-1}$. This construction thus gives us an action of the multiplicative group $\Aut(K)$
of automorphisms of the field $K$ on the additive abelian group $E(K)$, and hence also
on the $n$-torsion of this group for any positive integer~$n$.
In particular, if $\Qbar$ denotes an algebraic closure of the
rationals (for example, the algebraic numbers in $\bbC$) and if $\GQ$ denotes the group of field
isomorphisms $\Qbar\to\Qbar$, then for any elliptic curve $E$ over $\Q$ we have an action
of $\GQ$ on the additive abelian group $E(\Qbar)$, and hence on its $n$-torsion subgroup
$E(\Qbar)[n]$.

If furthermore $n=p$ is prime, then $E(\Qbar)[p]$ is naturally a vector space over the field $\Z/p\Z$,
and thus it inherits the structure of a mod $p$ representation of $\GQ$.
This is the \emph{mod $p$ Galois representation} attached to the elliptic curve $E$.

In the next section we apply this theory to an elliptic curve coming from a counterexample to Fermat's Last theorem.

\section{The Frey curve}

Recall that a \emph{Frey package} $(a,b,c,p)$ is simply a prime $p\geq5$ and nonzero pairwise-coprime
integers $a,b,c$ satisfying $a^p+b^p=c^p$ and satisfying the congruences
$a\equiv3\pmod4$ and $b\equiv0\pmod2$. We have shown above that if Fermat's Last Theorem is false,
then a Frey package exists.

\begin{definition}[Frey]
  \label{FLT.FreyCurve}
  \lean{FLT.FreyPackage.freyCurve}
  \uses{FLT.FreyPackage}\discussion{21}
  \leanok
  Given a Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$, the corresponding \emph{Frey curve} (considered by Frey and,
  before him, Hellegouarch) is the elliptic curve over $\Q$ defined by the equation
  $Y^2=X(X-a^p)(X+b^p).$
\end{definition}

Note that the roots of the cubic $X(X-a^p)(X+b^p)$ are distinct because $a,b,c$ are nonzero and
$a^p+b^p=c^p$.

Given a Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$ with corresponding Frey curve $E$, the mod $p$ Galois
representation associated to this package is the representation of $\GQ$ on $E(\Qbar)[p]$
described above. Frey's observation is that this mod $p$ Galois representation has some very
surprising properties. We will make this remark more explicit in the next chapter.
Here we shall show how these properties can be used to finish the job.

\section{Reduction to two big theorems.}

Recall that a representation of a group $G$ on a vector space $W$ is said to be \emph{irreducible}
if there are precisely two $G$-stable subspaces of $W$, namely $0$ and $W$.
The representation is said to be \emph{reducible} otherwise.

Now say $(a,b,c,p)$ is a Frey package.
Consider the mod $p$ representation of $\GQ$ coming from the $p$-torsion in the Frey
curve $Y^2=X(x-a^p)(X+b^p)$ associated to the package. Let's call this representation $\rho$,
and say that $\rho$ is the mod $p$ representation associated to the Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$.
Is it irreducible or not?

\begin{theorem}[Mazur]
  \label{FLT.Mazur_Frey}
  \lean{FLT.Mazur_Frey}
  \uses{FLT.FreyCurve}
  \leanok
  If $\rho$ is the mod $p$ Galois representation associated to a Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$ then
  $\rho$ is irreducible.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{Frey_curve_irreducible}
  \notready
  This follows from a profound and long result of Mazur \cite{mazur-torsion} from 1977,
  namely the fact that the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\Q$ can have size at most~16.
  In fact there is still a little more work which needs to be done to deduce the theorem from
  Mazur's result. A pre-1990 reference for the full proof of this claim is Proposition~6
  in~\S4.1 of~\cite{serreconj}.
\end{proof}

Note that in the first (pre-2029) phase of the FLT project, we will not be working on
a formalization of Mazur's 1977 result.

\begin{theorem}[Wiles,Taylor--Wiles, Ribet,\ldots]
  \label{FLT.Wiles_Frey}
  \lean{FLT.Wiles_Frey}
  \uses{FLT.FreyCurve}
  \leanok
  If $\rho$ is the mod $p$ Galois representation associated to a Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$ then
  $\rho$ is not irreducible.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
%  \uses{modularity_lifting_theorem,frey_curve_hardly_ramified,moret-bailly}
  This is the main content of Wiles' magnum opus.
  We omit the argument for now, although later on in this project
  we will have a lot to say about a proof of this.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{FLT.FreyPackage.false}
  \lean{FLT.FreyPackage.false}
  \uses{FLT.Mazur_Frey, FLT.Wiles_Frey}
  \leanok
  There is no Frey package.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}\leanok Follows immediately from the previous two
  theorems~\ref{FLT.Mazur_Frey} and~\ref{FLT.Wiles_Frey}.
\end{proof}

We deduce

\begin{corollary}
  \label{FLT}
  \lean{FLT.Wiles_Taylor_Wiles}
  \leanok
  Fermat's Last Theorem is true. In other words, there are no positive integers $a,b,c$ and
  natural $n\geq3$ such that $a^n+b^n=c^n$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{FLT.of_p_ge_5, FLT.FreyPackage.false, FLT.FreyPackage.of_not_FermatLastTheorem_p_ge_5}
  \leanok
  Assume there is a there is a counterexample $a^n+b^n=c^n$.
  By Corollary \ref{FLT.of_p_ge_5} we may assume that there is also a counterexample
  $a^p+b^p=c^p$ with $p\geq 5$ and prime.
  Then there is a Frey package $(a,b,c,p)$ by~\ref{FLT.FreyPackage.of_not_FermatLastTheorem_p_ge_5},
  contradicting Corollary~\ref{FLT.FreyPackage.false}.
\end{proof}
